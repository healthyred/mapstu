Description: This package first sorts data of which states, or countries that students
    come from each year at Williams College. Then it creates a data frame for ease of
    access. The next scripts find the changes in student acceptance from each area
    and creates a cloropleth map with different shades of red and green, representing
    respective decreases or increases in student acceptance per year.
