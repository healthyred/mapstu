#' The mapstu package uses the geographical distribution data of the entire
#' Williams College student population published in the Williams Course
#' Catalogs to compare which states, and countries students are from each
#' year. This is done for fifteen years from 2000 to 2015 by pulling data
#' from text versions of the geographical distribution data. The core
#' components of the package creates different cloropleth maps based on
#' the arguments passed to the function. With the visual support of
#' the cloropleth map, one can easily visualize the difference of
#' student geographical distribution between any two years of the data
#' set. A printed comparison of the two years can also produced.
